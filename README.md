# Purpose

Main aim is to create a reliable versioning scheme for data that goes into training of DeepMD neural network potential. This scheme is devided into separate steps:

1. load and standardize data from multiple different sources
2. specify conditions to update dataset after each training iteration
3. version data a record which have been used for training and which have not, this enables us to move forward and backward in iterations similarly to git versioning
4. quantify training errors and monitor the quality of the fit
5. log everything so we can search backwards what has been done in each step

# dpmd-tools

A collection of utilities aimed mainly at manipulating deep MD datasets

Contains tools:
* compare E-V plots for reference data and predictions
* plot data coverage in E-V space
* batch recompute script that does computations on specified remote hosts
* trajectory optimizer to find spacegroup of strcuctures along trajectory
* Oganov fingerprint clustering and selection for datasets
* constrain based filtering of dataset structures - supports iterative dataset
  growing
* upload_script that copies dataset files from local to remote server and neatly
  organizes the directories

# Environment

Needs to be installed in appropriate conda environment that has DeePMD-Kit
installed if you want to use dataset filtering based on NN predictions or compare
graphs! Use the environment files or install deepmd-kit from conda into your
the base environment.

```bash
conda env create -f environment_cpu.yml
conda activade dpmd_cpu
```

# Install

The package must be installed in order for the submodules to be importable.
Otherwise some scripts will not work.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ftl-fmfi/dpmd_tools.git
cd dpmd_tools
pip install -e .  #Â -e is for editable mode
```

If you want to read data from LAMMPS MD trajectories
```
pip install git+https://github.com/ftl-fmfi/py-extract-frames@master#egg=py-extract-frames
```

# Example

100 clusters found in ge136 MetaD trajectory by `data_cluster.py`. For 300K
136 atomstructures, fingerprinting takes roughly 2 hours and clustering is a
matter of minutes.
